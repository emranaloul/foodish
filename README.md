## Website Idea: 
The main idea for the website is to enable users to search for recipes according to some specification, like recipes for vegetarian or vegan diets, or recipes with specific nutritional specifications like the amount of carbs or the amount of fat and so on. 
Also the user can share his own recipes as well, and write recipes reviews.
